## Profile
Great software can revolutionize how people communicate & express creativity. Poor software can lead to loss of work, time, or money. Inspired by Dieter Rams, I use the following principles in an effort to create great software: 

- Understand the user and their experience & areas of expertise.
- Be forgiving, never blame the user.
- Be accessible by as many people as possible.
- Be easy-to-use, but not at the expense of usefulness.
- Be unobtrusive and honest.

## Experience
### Lead iOS Software Developer, [LayerVault][15]
_(July 2013–Present)_

I am the lead developer of LayerVault for Mac, which designers use to remotely sync and collaborate on design assets. Notable contributions include:

- Implementing sync engine to handle multiple files uploading and updating concurrently to keep the files up-to-date while minimizing resource usage.
- Working closely with the Rails website engineers to develop a modern API for remotely syncing files between computers and a centralized server.
- Efficiently tracking file changes and updating only changed data, rather than the whole file to minimize bandwidth usage and storage space.
- Extracting specific art assets from design files to improve customer workflow.
- Involvement in support conversations to better understand users’ needs.

### Lead iOS Software Developer, [Unbound Medicine][5]
_(November 2005–July 2013)_

Working for a Palm and Windows Mobile medical software company, I advocated for releasing our software on the iPhone and became the lead developer. Notable contributions include:

- Ported our publishing platform to iOS and used it to create and distribute [50+ medical apps to the App Store][19].
- Created a centralized sync service to ensure medical information is always up-to-date.
- Worked closely with graphic artists on the UI and interaction design, including the design language for both iOS and non-iOS apps.
- Wrote the original mobile optimized version of the company’s web platform which was ready at the original iPhone launch.
- Developed rich-text web-based tools for medical editors to review and edit content

### Software Developer, [Rochester Institute of Technology Library][7]
_(June 2004–May 2005)_

At RIT’s Educational Technology Center, I led a student-run team of developers to migrate our old media and equipment inventory system to a modern web-based system. As the team leader I was responsible for managing project requirements, setting deadlines, programing, and testing the system.

### Software Development CO-OP, [Boeing Rotorcraft][9]
_(June 2003–November 2003)_

As part of my CO-OP program, I worked on the V-22 avionic system assisting with software quality assurance testing, participating in software debugging roundtables, and investigating improvements in the software testing system.
